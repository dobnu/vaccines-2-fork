##TEMPORARY SECTION:

If you would like to test my code, please run the python script:
```
python animation/animation_option1.py
python animation/animation_option2.py
```

Both of these do the same thing - create an animation from 3 example pngs. The gif is in the img folder. The difference is how. Option 1 requires the user to specify which png files to put into the gif manually. Option 2 just requires the user to specify a file that contains all the pngs to make into a gif (but requires an additional package).
