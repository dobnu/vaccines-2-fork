# Schedules

This document is intended to be a list of our expected availability. Provide as much detail as is reasonable for you - we're all on very different schedules.

**Philip:** Planning to do the bulk of my coding Sunday morning or Monday evening; also happy to jump in briefly to help out with bug fixes at other times. Best to ping me on Slack.

**Sophia:** I am able to work on some of the planning items today (Friday), but then I won't have a lot of time to work until Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I would be good with taking on some of the later steps of the project. I usually check Slack and Discord for DMs.

**Qiwei:** I have free time on Monday afternoon and Tuesday since I have a synthesis assignment for another class need to work on during the weekend. Free to Slack me or DM me on Discord(JerryV7#7759).

**Kayne:** I have 3 hours Sunday morning, then Monday night/Tuesday night but not until after 9pm. I can be reached on Slack but feel free to text: 781-690-0506

**Bridget** I'm free most of the day Sunday and Monday. You can discord me (Bridget#2403). 

**Yune** My time is flexible. I can do the project everyday, but I still need to spare a lot of time for cs5800. I'm more likely to pay more effort on this repo on monday to Thursday. I am trying to build a function to write the data that startsin may 1and end in late november to a subsample.csv
